 *  the queue, it uses the method getBack() to find the back by traversing
 *  the queue from the front. This is much more expensive, because you have
 *  to search through the whole queue on every add() operation; however, it
 *  does save (a tiny amount of) memory and it does make the add() and
 *  remove() methods simpler, as they no longer have to maintain the refer-
 *  ence to the back of the queue.
