     *  few operations, so we'll end up shrinking and growing it very
     *  often.

     *  If we decrease by 50% when the the array drops to 50% full 50%
     *  full, then the resulting array will be 100% full. This means
     *  that, if the next operation is a push(), we will have to immedi-
     *  ately increase the size of the array again. But, now, the array
     *  is only 50% full so, if the next operation is a pop(), we'll
     *  shrink it again, and so on. This can lead to a lot of wasteful
     *  copying.
     *
     *  By decreasing only when the array is 25% full, the new array is
     *  itself only half-full so it will take many more pushes or pops
     *  before the size needs to change again. Similarly, when the array
     *  is expanded, it is half-full, which is a long way from the point
     *  where it shrinks (25% full) or grows again (100% full).
     *
     *  This is a good general principle if you're designing a structure
     *  that grows when it's full and shrinks when it's becoming empty:
     *  ensure that growing and shrinking both put the structure in a
     *  state where it won't need to grow or shrink again for a while.
