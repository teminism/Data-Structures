 *  A basic implementation of binary trees. When I implemented stacks,
 *  I created a class Stack, which had an inner class Stack.Item.  An
 *  object of the Stack class could represent any stack, empty or full.
 *  Here, I've taken a different approach: an object of the BinaryTree
 *  represents a tree with at least one node; an empty tree (one with
 *  no nodes) would be represented by just a null reference.  Each
 *  BinaryTree object represents a tree, with the value stored at its
 *  root and the left and right subtrees.

     *  tree containsWord the string s, we check if it's at the root. If not,
     *  we look in the left subtree by making a recursive call to
     *  containsWord(). If it's not in the left subtree, we look in the
     *  right subtree, the same way. Recall that the || and && operators
     *  use so-called short-circuit evaluation: that is, if the answer
     *  is known from looking at just the first operand, the second
     *  operand is not evaluated. (Using "true or anything = true" and
     *  "false and anything = false".) So if, e.g., value is null,
     *  value.equals(s) isn't called -- which is good, because it would
     *  throw a NullPointerException. Likewise, we only look in the
     *  left subtree if s isn't at the root, and only look in the right
     *  subtree if we've not already found s in the root or left sub-
     *  tree. This means we stop looking as soon as we find the string.
